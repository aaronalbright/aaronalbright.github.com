    <h2>What I did at the Alligator<br><small>(It wasn't reporting)</small></h2>
    <p>Unlike a lot of my other (fantastic) and fellow students at my student newspaper, the <a href="http://alligator.org">Independent Florida Alligator</a>, I didn't do a whole lot of writing. Outside of my reporting class, my story bylines were practically non-existent. I was primarily a sports photographer. However, that only describes front-facing work. Much of my time was spent behind the scenes.</p>
    <p>My time at the Alligator began in 2015 as a simple contributor. By August, I was on staff as a photographer. By January of 2016, I was the photo editor. During that time, I completely re-made the photo editing workflow, transferring most of the editing process to Adobe Lightroom, taking advantage of it's library structure to archive the photos more easily. Prior to this, photos were dumped on a hard drive with no meta or organization.</p>
    <p>In April of 2016, I became the Online Managing Editor. I held that position until December. During those nine months, I worked to optimize the workflow, which included responsibilities ranging from copy/pasting articles from the InDesign production file into the CMS, scheduling the following day's social media posts or making a chart or graphic for a story. This process was needlessly arduous. The result was a more streamlined flow that allowed my work to be more efficient.</p>
    <p>My main work as online managing editor was to redesign the home page and mobile design of the website. About a year prior to taking the position, the site transitioned to new a responsive template. However, it largely kept the same design it had prior: text heavy and using outdated plugins and template &quot;blocks&quot; as the CMS called them.</p>
    <p>I went for an image-emphasis and visual-first design. It was far from perfect, as I was constrained to the limitations of no CSS access, but it was an improvement. I then went to work on the mobile view, which had no specific layout for a narrow, single-column view. The result, after my work, was a mobile-friendly design that was easy to understand and a pleasure to work at.</p>
    <p>I also pioneered the implementation of Facebook Instant Articles and Google AMP Articles. As far as I know, the Alligator was the one of the first student publications to use them. With a staff of nearly 40 students, I learned valuable leadership skills that allowed me to effectively manage the newsroom on a daily basis alongside the editor in chief and print managing editor.</p>
